# Destiny 2 — SGA Resource Tree
A collection of resources useful for many Destiny 2 players. Feel free to contribute. This could not be possible without many of my friends who provided any additional resources and the many contributors of the following resources.

----------------------------
## Everyday Use
Everyone should have a use for these if not visit them every time they open Destiny.

### [Destiny Item Manager](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/) | [About](https://app.destinyitemmanager.com/about) | [Wiki & How To](https://destinyitemmanager.fandom.com/wiki/Category:User_Guide) (Web App)
[Available alternatives (mostly for mobile usage and console users).](#alt-items)

Destiny Item Manager (DIM) is a supremely useful resource for inventory management within Destiny (1 & 2). Practically a necessity. If you've ever had to use your Vault in-game or access a weapon that's on another character, you will know how much of a drag it is. This app allows you to transfer items between your characters and Vault in real time. It also features [WIP].

### [The Destiny 2 Data Compendium](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaxvbLx7UoSZaBqdFr1u32F2uWVLo-CJunJB4nlGUE4/) by [Pip1n](#discord-Pip1n) (Google Sheets)
The closest thing to a Destiny 2 wiki (in my opinion) from a gameplay standpoint. You will find most info about how the game works here. And if not, feel free to explore some of the other resources here or in Pip1n's spreadsheet.

### [Destiny 2 Companion](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Companion) by Bungie (Android & iOS)
The Official Destiny 2 Companion App allows you to manage almost everything you can do on bungie.net and then some, but primarily most people use it to acquire bounties remotely or redeem items from the Season Pass. But it can do many other things such as manage your inventory like DIM and view your quests, triumphs, and more, and even see a 3D view of your character. You can also manage your clan or look into Bungie's official LFG functionality via the Fireteams section (though almost nobody uses it AFAIK). 

A note or two, however, bounties can only be acquired while in Orbit or in a Social Space that's not a planetary Destination and only this app can buy bounties. No other app can do so because this is an official Bungie app and other apps that make use of the Destiny API **are not allowed** to do *destructive* changes to your account, such as using up your Glimmer. Imagine you fat-fingered something and deleted your entire Vault due to some automated process; that's the reason.

And now for a quick intermission — the next resources will have their own dedicated pages to reduce clutter.
